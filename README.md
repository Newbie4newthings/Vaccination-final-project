## **Development Notes**

### File Structure:
- `templates/`: Contains the HTML files for the app.
- `static/css/`: Stores CSS files for styling.
- `static/js/`: Contains JavaScript for dynamic behavior.
- `views.py`: Manages backend logic and API endpoints.
- `urls.py`: Defines routes for the application.

### Customization:
- Update the `styles.css` file in `static/css/` to modify the design.
- Extend the `views.py` file to add new features or endpoints.

## **Troubleshooting**

1. **Database Issues**:
   - Ensure migrations are correctly applied with:
     ```bash
     python manage.py makemigrations
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

2. **API Errors**:
   - Use tools like **Postman** to test endpoints and verify request payloads.

3. **Static Files Not Loading**:
   - Collect static files by running:
     ```bash
     python manage.py collectstatic
     ```

4. **JavaScript Errors**:
   - Open browser developer tools (F12) and check the console for logs.
